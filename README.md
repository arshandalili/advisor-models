## Setup

### Base environment

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install vllm
uv sync
```

Run ```uv sync``` to install local development dependencies. Activate your virtual environment with ```source .venv/bin/activate```.

To setup the (separate) training virtual environment for all example environments, run the following commands:

```bash
cd SkyRL/skyrl-train
uv sync --extra vllm
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Training script examples are provided in the ```advisor_models``` directory, along with templates for new environments. You will also need to have specified an ```OPENAI_API_KEY``` and ```WANDB_API_KEY``` in your environment.

## Advisor Models

### Overview

Customizing powerful, black-box models is a major challenge, with most practitioners typically limited to static prompting.

We propose a framework to train a small open-source “advisor” model to guide black-box models via feedback, optimizing the model to your specific environment, task, or users with RL.

We show that Advisor Models are highly effective for personalizing and adapting black-box models to specific environments. We additionally test the system in reasoning-intensive tasks, finding properties of the framework under which Advisor Models work best, and demonstrating the system robustness across models and environments.
